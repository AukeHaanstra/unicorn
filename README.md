# Unicorn Backend Web MVC Application examples illustrating Hexagonal Architecture and Domain Driven Design

This repository shows a three-layer architecture using best-practices for decoupling of its layers. It also shows
an adapter pattern to decouple a bounded context. This application can be readily refactored to hexagonal architecture
as is shown in the unicorn-hexagonal repository. Java modules can then be easily introduced as shown in the
unicorn-modules repository.

For example requests to the Web API, see UnicornAppRequests.postman_collection.json
